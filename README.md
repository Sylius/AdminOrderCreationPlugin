## Business value

So far it was up to the Customer to place an order using available product variants as well as payment and shipping
methods.

The whole process of placing an order is not that obvious, however. For some reason a Customer may feel a little bit
confused when a promotion is no longer available or shipping method is not eligible for given area. Here comes
Admin Order Creation Plugin.

Briefly speaking, it allows an Administrator to place or reorder an order in the name of a Customer. It helps them solve
even more of Customers' fundamental problems and equips an Administrator with basic tools making creating an 
order possible.

Admin Order Creation Plugin processes are strongly based on standard Order model taken from SyliusCoreBundle.
The only things that differ are order creation context and business requirements. Right now it is up to the Administrator
to provide a channel, locale and currency in which an Order is created. What's more, the Administrator is able to add
a discount for any item or the whole Order, which is, technically speaking, a new type of Sylius Adjustments.

After creating an Order via Admin panel, this new Order is listed like any other order placed via Sylius.

## Installation

#### Beware!

> This installation instruction assumes that you're using Symfony Flex. If you don't, take a look at the
[legacy installation instruction](docs/legacy_installation.md). However, we strongly encourage you to use
Symfony Flex, it's much quicker! :)

1. Require plugin with composer:

    ```bash
    composer require sylius/admin-order-creation-plugin
    ```
    
    > Remember to allow community recipes with `composer config extra.symfony.allow-contrib true` or during plugin installation process

2. Copy Sylius templates overridden in plugin to your templates directory (e.g `templates/bundles/`):

    ```bash
    mkdir -p templates/bundles/SyliusAdminBundle/
    cp -R vendor/sylius/admin-order-creation-plugin/src/Resources/views/SyliusAdminBundle/* templates/bundles/SyliusAdminBundle/
    ```

## Extension points

Admin Order Creation Plugin makes it possible to add custom discount during order creation - thus some of Order
Show templates need to be replaced with those placed in `Resources/views` package.

Payment link generation and sending process is based on logic placed in the PaymentLinkCreationListener class. Thus, it can
be easily replaced with suitable implementation.

Adjustments set is not closed and strictly defined - adding custom adjustment means defining a new constant in the
AdjustmentType class.

Significant part of Reorder Processing is inspired by official Sylius 
[Customer Reorder Plugin](https://github.com/Sylius/CustomerReorderPlugin/). In case of the need for more processors,
just add new class implementing `ReorderProcessor` interface, declare it in `reorder_processing.xml` file and match
it with a proper tag.

Admin Order Creation process is based on Symfony Forms. To find out more about Symfony Forms extension possibilities, check out
[Symfony Docs](https://symfony.com/doc/current/form/create_form_type_extension.html).
