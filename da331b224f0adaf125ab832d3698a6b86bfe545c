Hello @Roshyo! Even though we're not supporting this plugin actively nowadays, this PR is definitely something we would like to have :) I've enabled proper builds and made some changes in dependencies, but it requires a little bit of work to be mergeable. Do you think you would be able to fix it in the nearest future, or should I take it over?

Cheers ðŸ––

Well, since I will be away for the next 3 weeks or so. I would love it if you could take over on that point.

Or it will have to wait until I get back.
